# HTML_CSS_SurveyForm
Designed a survey form using HMTL and CSS. 

Made use of a lot of input type html elements such as text inputs, select inputs, email inputs, number inputs, radio inputs, checkbox inputs, textareas, and submit inputs. 

Used the fieldsets in css to divide each part. To divide the form from the rest of the page I made use of the form element in css. Played around with color theory to make everything look clean and easy to read.
